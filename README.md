# commandArgsParser
Yet another small command line arguments parser with C and C++ interface. You can find examples in source/example directory.

Building
=====================
You need cmake program for building. Run build.sh on Linux platform or build.bat on Windows (you need MSVC). Tests are based on gtest framework and not necessary for library.
